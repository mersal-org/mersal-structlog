Development setup
------------------

Mersal-structlog uses `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ for dependency
management and `mise <https://mise.jdx.dev/>`_ to run project tasks.

.. code-block:: shell

   mise run install    # create the venv, install deps
   mise run lint         # format the code
   mise run type-check    # mypy + basedpyright

Run ``mise tasks`` to see everything available.

Note: this package doesn't have a test suite or docs build set up yet.

Versioning
----------

mersal-structlog follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

The version number is **never** hand-edited in ``pyproject.toml``. It is
derived entirely from git tags via `hatch-vcs
<https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs>`_:

- On a commit that is exactly a tag (e.g. ``v1.2.3``), the package version is
  ``1.2.3``.
- On any other commit, the version is a development version derived from the
  most recent tag, e.g. ``1.2.4.dev3`` for the 3rd commit after ``v1.2.3``.

This means making a release is just a matter of pushing a tag -- there is no
version-bump commit or changelog-file merge conflict to manage.

Making a release
-----------------

1. Make sure ``main`` is green (CI passing) and contains everything you want
   to ship.
2. Decide the next version per SemVer:

   - **patch** (``1.2.3`` -> ``1.2.4``): bug fixes only, no API changes.
   - **minor** (``1.2.3`` -> ``1.3.0``): new, backwards-compatible functionality.
   - **major** (``1.2.3`` -> ``2.0.0``): breaking changes.

3. Tag the release and push the tag:

   .. code-block:: shell

      git tag v1.2.4
      git push origin v1.2.4

4. Go to `GitHub Releases
   <https://github.com/mersal-org/mersal_structlog/releases/new>`_, pick the
   tag you just pushed, click **Generate release notes**, review, and click
   **Publish release**.

5. Publishing the release triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml
   <.github/workflows/publish.yml>`_, which builds the package with the
   version baked in from the tag and uploads it to PyPI using `Trusted
   Publishing <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`_ -- no API tokens
   involved.

Continuous pre-releases on Test PyPI
-------------------------------------

Every push to ``main`` automatically builds the package and uploads it to
`Test PyPI <https://test.pypi.org/project/mersal-structlog/>`_ under its dev
version (e.g. ``1.2.4.dev3``):

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple mersal-structlog

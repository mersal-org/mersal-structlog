Development setup
------------------

Mersal-structlog uses `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ for dependency
management and `mise <https://mise.jdx.dev/>`_ to run project tasks.

.. code-block:: shell

   mise run install    # create the venv, install deps
   mise run lint         # format the code
   mise run type-check    # mypy + basedpyright

Run ``mise tasks`` to see everything available.

Note: this package doesn't have a test suite or docs build set up yet.

Versioning
----------

mersal-structlog follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

The version number is **never** hand-edited in ``pyproject.toml``. It is
derived entirely from git tags via `hatch-vcs
<https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs>`_:

- On a commit that is exactly a tag (e.g. ``v1.2.3``), the package version is
  ``1.2.3``.
- On any other commit, the version is a development version derived from the
  most recent tag, e.g. ``1.2.4.dev3`` for the 3rd commit after ``v1.2.3``.

There is no version-bump commit or changelog-file merge conflict to manage --
but note the release pipeline below stamps the version explicitly rather
than waiting for the tag to exist (see step 3).

Making a release
-----------------

The tag and GitHub Release are the **last** things created, not the first --
if PyPI publishing fails partway through, nothing is tagged and no version
number is burned.

1. Make sure ``main`` is green (CI passing) and contains everything you want
   to ship.
2. Decide the next version per SemVer:

   - **patch** (``1.2.3`` -> ``1.2.4``): bug fixes only, no API changes.
   - **minor** (``1.2.3`` -> ``1.3.0``): new, backwards-compatible functionality.
   - **major** (``1.2.3`` -> ``2.0.0``): breaking changes.

3. Go to `Actions -> Build & Publish Package
   <https://github.com/mersal-org/mersal_structlog/actions/workflows/publish.yml>`_,
   click **Run workflow**, enter the version (e.g. ``1.2.4``, no leading
   ``v``), and dispatch it on ``main``.

4. `.github/workflows/publish.yml <.github/workflows/publish.yml>`_ then:

   - builds the package with that exact version stamped in via
     ``SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION`` (the tag doesn't need to exist yet),
   - publishes it to PyPI using `Trusted Publishing
     <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`_ -- no API tokens involved,
   - and only once that succeeds, tags the commit ``v1.2.4`` and creates the
     `GitHub Release <https://github.com/mersal-org/mersal_structlog/releases>`_ with
     ``--generate-notes``.

If any step fails, fix the issue and re-run the workflow with the same
version -- nothing was tagged or released.

Continuous pre-releases on Test PyPI
-------------------------------------

Every push to ``main`` automatically builds the package and uploads it to
`Test PyPI <https://test.pypi.org/project/mersal-structlog/>`_ under its dev
version (e.g. ``1.2.4.dev3``):

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple mersal-structlog
